I'm Xiaoxue Leng, now working at University of Staying at Home.

My research interests include effective learning, technology-based learning. Specifically, I'm working on optimizing instructional guidance, finding out effective learning strategies, and also, exploring the underlying mechanisms of learning.

By 2024, I've received my bachelor and master degree in psychology from Central China Normal University. From 2021 to 2024, I was supervised by [Dr. Fuxing Wang](https://psych.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1132/5162.htm) and worked as a lab member in the [Learning and Child Development Lab](https://fxwang1.wixsite.com/landcdlab).
