I'm Xiaoxue Leng, now working at University of Staying at Home.

I'm very interested in science of learning and how to promote people's effective learning. Specifically, I'm working on optimizing instructional guidance, finding out effective learning strategies, and also, exploring the underlying mechanisms of learning.

Also, I'm interested in learning with new techonologies. The development of techonologies such as AI or GPT has provided us new ways of learning, making learning more efficient and changing people's learning styles. How to use these technologies for people's effecitve learning? Sometimes, ChatGPT can provide wrong answers (e.g., ChatGPT may tell us 9.11 is greater than 9.8). How can we evaluate whether it's a truth or a misinformation? What can we do to use new technologies more efficiently?

By 2024, I've received my bachelor and master degree in psychology from Central China Normal University, CCNU. From 2021 to 2024, I was supervised by [Dr. Fuxing Wang](https://psych.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1132/5162.htm) and worked as a research assistant in the [Learning and Child Development Lab](https://fxwang1.wixsite.com/landcdlab) in CCNU. Now, I'm working with Dr. Fuxing Wang at CCNU and [Dr. Ziyi Kuang](https://psych.snnu.edu.cn/info/1153/6577.htm) at Shaanxi Normal University.
