I'm Xiaoxue Leng, now working at University of Staying at Home.

I'm very interested in how to promote people's effective learning. Specifically, I'm working on optimizing instructional guidance, finding out effective learning strategies, and also, exploring the underlying mechanisms of learning.

By 2024, I've received my bachelor and master degree in psychology from Central China Normal University, CCNU. From 2021 to 2024, I was supervised by [Dr. Fuxing Wang](https://psych.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1132/5162.htm) and worked as a research assistant in the [Learning and Child Development Lab](https://fxwang1.wixsite.com/landcdlab) in CCNU. Now, I'm working with [Dr. Ziyi Kuang](https://psych.snnu.edu.cn/info/1153/6577.htm) at Shaanxi Normal University.

My CV can be found here. [XiaoxueLeng's CV](../assets/xiaoxueleng_cv_short.pdf)
