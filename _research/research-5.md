A pedagogical agent (PA) is a virtual character presented on the screen designed to improve learning interest and outcomes in multimedia environments. PAs’ visual appearance except gender has received little attention.

Contextual Relevance: The conformity of an agent's visual characteristics to the content area under which the agent purports to function (Veletsianos, 2007). When agent’s visual appearance matches people’s stereotypes, people may have greater interest and better performance.

People held a stereotype that White people are more knowledgeable on English than Asian people. Does this stereotype influence English learning?

In this project, I worked with Dr. Ziyi Kuang at Shaanxi Normal University. We:
- Investigated whether students’ stereotype towards pedagogical agents influenced their learning;
- Investigated whether pedagogical agent’s race influenced students’ learning interest and performance.

A total of 12- and 13-year-old children learned one English course with a White or Asian PA in the AutoTutor. Results showed PA's race influenced children's feelings and learning performance.

We have finished the data analysis, and now are working on the final manuscript.

My responsibilities included: Reviewed relevant literature; designed experiments; analyzed data; wrote manuscript
