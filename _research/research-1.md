In this project, we:
- Investigated whether EMME can train learners to use text-picture processing strategy and compared the effectiveness of EMME and traditional verbal training on strategy training by using eye-tracking techniques;
- Compared whether EMME is more beneficial on guiding attention and improving learning than traditional visual cues by using eye-tracking techniques.

My responsibility included: Reviewed relevant literature; designed experiments; collected and analyzed behavioral data and eye-tracking data; wrote manuscript
