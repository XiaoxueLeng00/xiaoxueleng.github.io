Producing gestures promoted people comprehension of a spoken message effectively (Drague et al., 2019). However, no previous studies have investigated whether producing gestures can facilitate children’s memory on route information. Does generating gestures improve children’s memory on route information?

<i>Representational Mapping Hypothesis.</i> When there is a higher degree of mapping between gestures and mental representations, people gain more from gestures. Since different gestures matched different types of information (e.g., pointing gesture -- location), how different types of gestures (i.e., pointing, directional, and tracing) facilitate children’s recall on location and route items?

In this project, I worked with Dr. Fuxing Wang. We:
- Investigated whether producing gestures improved children's memory;
- Investigated how different types of gestures facilitated children’s recall on location and route items.

Two experiments were conducted. A total of 168 4- and 5-year-old children participated in these two experiments. Results showed:
- Producing gestures promoted children’s memory on route information;
- In line with Representational Mapping Hypothesis, pointing gestures facilitated memory on locations, while directional and tracing gestures promoted memory on routes.

We have finished the data analysis, and now are working on the final manuscript.

My responsibilities included: Data collection and analysis, visualization, and most of writing.
