In this project, we:
- Investigated whether learners perform better when learning from a first-person view than from a third-person view and compared learnersâ€™ brain activity under the two conditions by using fNIRS.

My responsibility included: Reviewed relevant literature; designed experiments; collected behavioral data and neuroimaging data by using fNIRS; analyzed data by using Matlab; wrote manuscript
