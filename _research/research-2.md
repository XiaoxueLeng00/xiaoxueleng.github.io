In this project, we:
- Investigated how learning-by-teaching promotes learning and what are the boundary conditions;
- Investigated whether drawing can facilitate learning-by-teaching;
- Investigated whether instructor-provided cues and student-generated cues can facilitate learning-by-teaching.

My responsibility included: Reviewed relevant literature; designed experiments; collected behavioral, eye-tracking, physiological, and fNIRS data; reviewed and edited manuscripts
