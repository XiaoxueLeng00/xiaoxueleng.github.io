In this paper, we attempted to compare the effectiveness of visual training (i.e., eye movement modeling examples) and verbal training on how to use a text-picture strategy for learning from computer-based multimedia materials.

Sixty-nine university students were randomly assigned to three groups: the verbal training group (students received text-based instruction for a text-picture processing strategy), the visual training group (students observed a video depicting an expert's eye fixations while using a text-picture processing strategy for an initial portion of a multimedia lesson) or the control group (students did not receive any instruction). Students firstly acquired new strategies, and then learned a new material. 

Results showed that, on learning outcomes, both visual and verbal training helped students perform better than the control group on a recall test and the verbal training group perform better on a transfer test. Concerning learning processes, both visual andverbal training caused students to attend less to on-screen text and more to on-screen pictures as compared to the control group. Mediation analysis showed that increased attention to pictures was a mediator for better learning outcomes.
