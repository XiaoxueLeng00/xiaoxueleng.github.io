In this study, we examined whether having the instructor wear a mask during a video lecture affects learning.

In Experiment 1, we compared learning outcomes and visual attention between the mask group and the control group. Sixty-one college students watched an instructional video on the formation of lightning, in which an instructor who either did or did not wear a mask asshe stood next to slides and lectured. Learners' learning outcomes did not differ significantly, but learners spent significantly less time looking at the instructor's face when she was masked.  

In Experiment 2, we used a 2 (mask vs. no-mask) * 2 (slides vs. no-slides) between-subject design. One hundred and one college students were randomly assigned to the four groups. Results showed that there was a significant interaction in which adding slides improved learning outcomes with a masked instructor, but not with an unmasked instructor. Adding a mask lowered student ratings of social presence with the instructor.
