The viewing perspective effect refers to the finding that students learn better from instructional videos recorded from first-person perspective than third-person perspective, but little is known about the neural mechanism underlying this effect. This study investigated the underlying neural mechanism of the viewing perspective effect by fNIRS. 

In Experiment 1, we replicated previous studies by using paper folding tasks (i.e., butterfly and four-leaf clover). Participants were randomly assigned to the first-person view group (i.e., watching videos recorded from a first-person view) or the third-person view group (i.e., watching videos recorded from a third-person view). Results showed that viewing perspective effect was present in the butterfly task.

In Experiment 2, we extended viewing perspective research by using neuroimaging methodology. Participants were randomly assigned to the two groups as in Experiment 1, but with fNIRS probes placed on each student's head. Participants watched the butterfly video (watching phase) and then performed the task (imitation phase). Results showed that there was superior performance on the butterfly task with a first-person view over a third-person view. There was higher cortical activation in the first-person view group in the right dlPFC during the watching phase, and higher cortical activation in third-person view group in the left IPC during the imitation phase.
